# masken

A little game I do in my spare time.

## Project Goals
* unnoticable startup and loading times (targeting 1/12 of a second)
* low compile time (target is to stay under 1 second)
* assets are presented correcly (e.g. no streaming in of textures)
* run at display refresh rate

## Assumptions
* minimum disk read speed: 520 MiB/s (43.3 MiB in 1/12s)
* max display refresh rate: 720Hz
